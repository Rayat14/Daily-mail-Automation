# Daily-mail-Automation
Automated Daily Email Script using Shell and Mutt  This repository contains a simple shell script leveraging Mutt to send automated daily emails. Easily configurable with Gmail credentials, the script is scheduled using cron for daily execution. Enhance your workflow by automating routine email updates.
To schedule a daily automatic email at a specific time using a shell script, you can use a combination of a cron job and a script to send the email. Here's a simple example using mutt for sending emails and cron for scheduling:

Install mutt:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install mutt
Create a script, for example, send_daily_email.sh:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Gmail credentials
GMAIL_USER="your@gmail.com"
GMAIL_PASSWORD="your_password"

# Email details
TO_EMAIL="recipient@example.com"
SUBJECT="Daily Update"
BODY="Hello,

This is your daily update.

Regards,
Your Name"

# Sending email using mutt
echo "$BODY" | mutt -s "$SUBJECT" -e "set content_type=text/plain" -- "$TO_EMAIL" -e "my_hdr From:$GMAIL_USER" -- "$GMAIL_USER" -- -i <(echo -e "set smtp=smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465\nset smtp-auth=login\nset smtp-auth-user=$GMAIL_USER\nset smtp-auth-password=$GMAIL_PASSWORD\nset ssl_verify_host=yes\nset ssl_starttls=no")
Make sure to replace "your@gmail.com" and "your_password" with your actual Gmail credentials. Also, update the TO_EMAIL, SUBJECT, and BODY variables according to your needs.

Make the script executable:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x send_daily_email.sh
Open your crontab for editing:
bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add a line to schedule the script at the desired time (e.g., daily at 8 AM):
bash
Copy code
0 8 * * * /path/to/send_daily_email.sh
Replace /path/to/send_daily_email.sh with the actual path to your script.

This example schedules the script to run every day at 8 AM. You can customize the cron schedule according to your specific needs using the cron syntax.

Remember to consider security concerns, such as storing your Gmail password securely and ensuring the appropriate permissions for the script. Additionally, consider using an "App Password" or OAuth for more secure authentication.
